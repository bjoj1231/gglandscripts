# Copy of run_gen_data.sh with a few modifications to give us boosted particels. It's the only difference.
# This is a script that will help generate data using ggland. It needs a file as input which have specfic commands in a specific order to work.
# ggland then creates at root-file which is opened p√• by ROOT. From here the .txts containing the gun_vals etc. will be generated.
# Since this script is in the folder ~/bin it can be accessed from everywhere on the remote pc but should be run from the folder where ggland is installed.
# Run this command to generate data.
